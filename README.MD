# Luhn (Mod 10) Algorithm in Python 3+

> This repository is purely for reference and is illustrative in it is purpose. This is one of the many ways of implementing this algorithm. 


This project illustrates an implementation of the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) in Python. The Luhn Algorithm is the 
standard method of validating if a credit card number is valid prior to authorization. It is also an interesting algorithm as it teaches
a lot of the basics and nuances of a language through implementation.


## Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Python 3 installed
* PyTest installed (to run the unit tests if need be)

## Testing

* Issue from the command line **pytest**


## Notes

* This repository is heavily commented to provide context as to what and why, if in VS Code feel free to collapse all comments if they are obtrusive
    * On Mac -> Press <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> then <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> 
    * On Windows & Linux -> Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> 
* The checkdigits validated are from various sites across the web, there will be more added and augmentation of the algorithm when edge cases are found.
